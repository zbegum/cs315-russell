Example- Football Team: Array declaration and assignment
This test program creates an array with 11 elements each of which represents a
football team player's health state (true: infected) (false: healthy)
If the player is infected it means the player next to that (only the right one) is also
infected.
The changed array is the final health state of the team.

{
	A:myArray = 11;
	A:myArray = {true, false, ...true, false, false, true, false};
	$bool prev = true;
	for_each(i @ A:myArray){
		if(prev){
			prev = i;
			i = true;
		}
		else{
			prev = i;
		}
	}
}
